## ml-digit-classifier

This project classifies handwritten images using a training data set. It uses a machine learning algorithm (perceptron algorithm) to train a linear classifier based on image features and detect if a handwritten digit is a number from 0 to 9. The project also uses a convolutional neural network algorithm.
